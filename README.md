# Row Stationary Convolution Accelerator

PE Cluster modelled after Eyeriss

### How to run

1. Run test.ipynb in one of the folders to create the input text files.
2. `cd sim`
2. and then you can use your simulator of choice.

### Todo

* PE cluster control based on layer information metadata (currently the row-stationary control is inside a testbench)
* Saturation logic + lower output precision
* Actual buffer logic, single cycle input delay
